Replaces the "I'm not a robot" text on reCAPTCHA challenges with "I'm a robot"

## Installation

I don't feel like paying $5 for a silly meme, so you'll have to install this in developer mode.

- Download the extension and unzip it anywhere
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Enable developer mode
- Click 'load unpacked' in the upper-left
- Navigate to wherever you unzipped it to
- Click 'open' or 'select' or whatever

Use https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo to test. If it doesn't work... I
dunno what to tell you.
